  - to me it seems that this program does not incorperate custome Css files but rather pules from a library of CSS feutures.
### JavaScript
- I dont know enough about JavaScript to make a jusgment but it seems again that it is run with a library of java commands in mind.

### Notes

  - In my experimenting with MS Connect I attempted to run a data file and determined that the program is useless without installing programs.
  - I attempted to install a data reading program but got sidetracked trying to figure it out.
  - I found a tutorial that will teach me how to move forward from here.
  - In this reserch I also documented there comunity pages, I think it is interesting that these community pages have 1 active community member. With this in mind I think two things need to be considered for the future, one advertizing so others can use and develop the app. Two, I need to find out what this product has that others don't that make it stand out and make it unique from other programs.
