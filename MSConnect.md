  - to me it seems that this program does not incorperate custome Css files but rather pules from a library of CSS feutures.
### JavaScript
- I dont know enough about JavaScript to make a jusgment but it seems again that it is run with a library of java commands in mind.

### Notes

  - In my experimenting with MS Connect I attempted to run a data file and determined that the program is useless without installing programs.
  - I attempted to install a data reading program but got sidetracked trying to figure it out.
  - I found a tutorial that will teach me how to move forward from here.
  - In this reserch I also documented there comunity pages, I think it is interesting that these community pages have 1 active community member. With this in mind I think two things need to be considered for the future, one advertizing so others can use and develop the app. Two, I need to find out what this product has that others don't that make it stand out and make it unique from other programs.

- Today I picked up where I left off and looked into uploading raw type files to the websight. What I discoverd is that it isnt too bad. First you need to go to the help bar, then download the raw file uploader. from there you just need to incert your file inot the uploader, change a default setting and you have your data on the websight.
- I do think that the raw file uploader seems like a hassle in itself, so if there is a way to upload the files that would be way easier then I should look into it. If we want this to go public and go but then it needs to be user friendly. THe raw file uploader is programed in C# so I will have to learn a compleatly new language. I do think that there should be either an uploader on the websight or a tuttorial on the websight, one of these should be implimented in order to maxamize efficiency.
- After reading through the raw file uploader code it apears that I do not understand how it functions at all.
